## Start Here

This pattern has completed all steps (sans Step4 - Optional: Configure observability and metrics) in the [kuadrant installation guide](https://docs.kuadrant.io/0.8.0/kuadrant-operator/doc/install/install-openshift/). 

The next steps are to follow the documentation to [secure, protect, and connect APIs with Kuadrant on OpenShift](https://docs.kuadrant.io/0.8.0/kuadrant-operator/doc/user-guides/secure-protect-connect-single-multi-cluster/)

## Rationale

The goal for this pattern is to:

* Use a GitOps approach to deploy Red Hat Connectivity Link (kuadrant)
* Securely manage secrets across the deployment.
